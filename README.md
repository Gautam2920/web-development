# Web Development Projects Repository

## Web Development

This repo exists for one reason: to build.

Each directory represents a complete project with its own files,
structure, and logic. Every folder is something that runs, renders, or
does something real in the browser.

If that structure works for you, feel free to use it.

---

## Repository Structure

The repo is organized by **Project Name → Project Files**.

Example:

    rock-paper-scissors/
    │
    ├── index.html
    ├── styles.css
    ├── game.js
    └── ui.js

Each project is self-contained.

No shared dependencies.\
No hidden coupling.\
Open a folder. Run it. Done.

---

## What This Repo Focuses On

- Building complete, functional web projects
- Practicing clean file organization
- Improving structure and readability
- Applying concepts through implementation
- Moving from tutorial knowledge to actual execution

This is not a notes repository.\
It is a build log.

## Philosophy Behind This Repo

Learning web development is not about memorizing syntax.

It is about:

- Writing HTML that makes sense
- Styling with intention
- Structuring JavaScript logically
- Separating concerns
- Refactoring when something feels messy

---

## How to Use This Repo

You can:

- Clone it and explore individual projects
- Use project structures as reference
- Rebuild projects in your own way
- Track your own web development journey similarly

Or just open a folder and see how it works.

---

## Contributions

This is primarily a personal build repository.

Suggestions, improvements, architectural discussions, and constructive
criticism are always welcome.

Learning scales better when shared.

---

## Final Note

Web development skill is earned through repetition and iteration.

You build.\
You refactor.\
You improve.

Then you build again.

This repo documents that process.

---
Happy Coding.
